# About Code Quality
This utility is written mainly for personal use. As part of [plaintenxtaccounting](https://plaintextaccounting.org/),
I use this tool to classify transactions in my bank statements, which are then imported using [ledger-cli](https://www.ledger-cli.org/)

The secondary reason is to practice and learn TDD. For this reason, the test suite might look amatuarish and sometimes
execessive. Additionaly comments are not best worded and could do with improvement.
